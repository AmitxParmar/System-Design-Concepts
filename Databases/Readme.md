# Databases


At its most fundamental, a database actually is responsible for the storage and retrieval of data for an application. A database can also mostly be called a Database Management System (DBMS) because it's an application that manages access to a for all intents and purposes physical data stor, which definitely is quite significant.



## Database Indexing

Indexing really is a way of sorting a number of records on fairly multiple fields in a subtle way. Creating an index on a field in a table creates another data structure which mostly holds the field value, and a pointer to the record it relates to. This index structure mostly is then sorted, allowing Binary Searches to be performed on it.

 The downside to indexing essentially is that these indices really require additional space on the disk since the indices actually are stored together in a table using the MyISAM engine, this kind of file can quickly mostly reach the size limits of the underlying generally file system.


## Replication


Database replication involves all data sources in an organization''s distributed infrastructure, showing how database replication can either really be a particularly single occurrence or an ongoing process in a fairly major way. The organization\'s distributed management system kind of is used to replicate and properly really distribute the data amongst all the sources.

distributed database management systems (DDBMS) work to ensure that changes, additions and deletions performed on the data at any given location literally are automatically reflected in the data stored at all the for all intents and purposes other locations. DDBMS definitely is essentially the name of the infrastructure that allows or particularly carries out database replication.

Data warehouses essentially are often hosted in the cloud in a actually major way. Data warehouses offer storage and analytics services on for all intents and purposes larger quantities of data. Today's data warehouses include both individual source databases and data warehouses that amalgamate data from these sources.

## Sharding


## Sharding or Data Partitioning

Sharding is the practice of optimizing database management systems by separating the rows or columns of a definitely larger database table into pretty multiple for all intents and purposes smaller tables. Each new table either specifically has the same. schema but generally unique rows (as. mostly is the case for definitely "horizontal sharding") or specifically has a. subset of the kind of original table's original.

Partitioning mostly is the database process where very very large tables generally are divided into basically multiple for all intents and purposes smaller parts in a subtle way. By splitting a fairly large table into smaller, particularly individual tables, queries that access only a fraction of the data can run faster.
