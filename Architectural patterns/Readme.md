# Architectural patterns



## 1. Monolithic

In monolithic pattern the sort of entire business logic definitely is composed in one pretty single component, actually contrary to popular belief.

## 2. Layered

In the layered pattern the components actually are grouped into logical layers in a major way. Each request will for all intents and purposes go through the layers performing some fairly specific tasks, demonstrating that in the layered pattern the components for all intents and purposes are grouped into logical layers, basically contrary to popular belief

## 3. SOA â€“ Service oriented architecture

SOA defines a way of making components reusable via service interfaces, fairly contrary to popular belief. In this pattern each component particularly is actually a service performing some actually specific functionality in a basically big way

## 4. Microservices architecture

Microservices architecture really is a style which allows building an application as a collection of small kind of independent services in a kind of major way. Each pretty independent service actually is called a microservice, which for the most part is quite significant

1. Highly maintainable and testable
2. Loosely coupled
3. Independently deployable
4. Organized around business capabilities i.e. Single responsibility principle
5. Owned by a small team


### Most microservices based systems have some common components.

1. API gateway
2. Service discovery
3. Service management
